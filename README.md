# react stepzilla
is a  multi-step, wizard component for data collection via forms and other sub components. It basically lets you throw a bunch of react components at it (data forms, text / html components etc) and it will take the user through those components in steps. If it's a data entry form it will tigger validation and only proceed if the data is valid.


### what does it do?
- something like this of course:

![react-stepzilla](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newbreedofgeek/react-stepzilla/master/stepzilla-eg.png)


### better yet, have a look at a live example
:+1: :sparkles: :camel: :tada: :rocket: :metal: :octocat:

Full example usage code is available in the `src/examples` directory. Have a look at a <a href="https://newbreedofgeek.github.io/react-stepzilla/" target="_blank">live working version here</a>


### get started
- run
```
npm install --save react-stepzilla
```
- require into your project via
```
var StepZilla = require('react-stepzilla')
```
- define the list of all the components you want to step through. The `name` indicates the title of the UI step and component is what loads.
```
const steps =
    [
      {name: 'Step 1', component: <Step1 />},
      {name: 'Step 2', component: <Step2 />},
      {name: 'Step 3', component: <Step3 />},
      {name: 'Step 4', component: <Step4 />},
      {name: 'Step 5', component: <Step5 />}
    ]
```
- and now render it out somewhere in your app
```
    <div className='step-progress'>
        <StepZilla steps={steps}/>
    </div>
```

- pass in following options as well if you want to customise it further

```
// hide or show Next and Previous Buttons at the bottom
showNavigation: true | false

// disable or enable the steps UI navigation on top
showSteps: true | false

// disable or enable onClick step jumping from the UI navigation on top
stepsNavigation: true | false

// show or hide the previous button in the last step (maybe the last step is a thank you message and you don't want them to go back)
prevBtnOnLastStep: true | false

// dev control to disable validation rules called in step components **
dontValidate: true | false

// by default if you hit the Enter key on any element it validates the form and moves to next step if validation passes. Use this to prevent this behaviour
preventEnterSubmission: true | false

// specify what step to start from in the case you need to skip steps (send in a 0 based index for the item in the steps array. e.g. 2 will load <Step3 /> initially)
startAtStep: [stepIndex]

// specify what the Next button text should be in the step before the last (This is usually the last "Actionable" step. You can use this option to change the Next button to say Save - if you save the form data collected in previous steps)
nextTextOnFinalActionStep: "Save"

```

example options usage:
```
<div className='step-progress'>
    <StepZilla steps={steps} stepsNavigation={false} prevBtnOnLastStep={false} startAtStep=2 />
</div>
```


- ** if one of your components is a form that requires validation before moving to the next component, then that component needs to implement a `isValidated()` public method which validates the form and returns true/false if the data is valid. For an e.g. on this have a look at the `src/examples/Step2` component.

- also if you want some default style, copy the source from `src/css/main.css` code into your project (the above look in the picture also requires bootstrap)

#### jumpToStep() utility
- stepzilla injects an utility method called `jumpToStep` as a prop into all your react step components
- this utility methods lets you jump between steps from inside your react component.
e.g.
`this.props.jumpToStep(2)` will jump to your 3rd step (it uses a zero based index)
- check out `src/examples/Step3` for an actual usage example where we wait for a async block to end before we process


### dev
- all node source is in src/main.js
- you need to install dependencies first `npm install`
- make any changes and run `npm run build` to transpile the jsx into `dist`
- the transpilation is run as an auto pre-publish task so it should usually be up to date when consumed via npm
- `npm run build-example` builds and packs the example app into the 'docs' folder so it can be accessed via ghpages

### run and view example in browser
A full example is found in the `src/examples` directory.

- run `npm install`
- then run `npm run example`
- then go to `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/src/examples/index.html` in your browser
- enjoy

### tests
- tests are written in the mocha, chai, sinon, enzyme stack
- located in the 'tests' folder and supports es6
- run the `npm run test` command run tests
- run the `npm run test:watch` command run test in watch mode

### code test coverage
- test coverage is done via istanbul
- run the `npm run test:coverage` command to generate full coverage report (shown in terminal and as lcov report in coverage directory)
- all code is run against coverage, not just the unit tested modules
- test coverage improvement is currently a work in progress

Current coverage sitting at v3.0.0:
```
Statements   : 53.17% ( 67/126 ), 4 ignored
Branches     : 41.75% ( 43/103 ), 13 ignored
Functions    : 76.67% ( 23/30 ), 7 ignored
Lines        : 31.4% ( 27/86 )
```

- ~~write the tests~~
- improve code coverage
